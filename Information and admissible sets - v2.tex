I explore the effect of incorporating information for a non-parametric binary choice model. The model permits endogenous variation in a scalar random variable due to non-random selection, and it is the average causal effect of this endogenous variable on the outcome variable that is of interest. The model embeds an exclusion restriction and an independence restriction that together define an instrumental variable but is silent as to the relationship between the endogenous variable and the instrumental variable. I restrict the relationship between the outcome variable and the endogenous variable up to a non-parametric threshold crossing function. The model is credible \citep{book.manski} in that it embeds only weak non-verifiable restrictions, but does not identify the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable.\footnote{Assumptions that cannot be tested using data; the model does embed some non-trivial non-verifiable restrictions that might be relaxed.} Rather, the model partially identifies the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable. 

I define information to be those additional characteristics of economic agents that are observable with the caveat that these characteristics be exogenous and relevant to the latent structure. It is convenient to think of such characteristics as being predetermined and immutable; characteristics that result from choices that are made jointly with the outcome variable are excluded by the definition. Accordingly, exogenous variables and instrumental variables are regarded as information. I study how the admissible set of values for the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable changes as each class of information is incorporated separately.

It is useful to distinguish between different classes of information since each class enters the latent structure in a different way. Exogenous variables enter the structural equation for the outcome variable and so can be seen to enrich individual response. A consequence is that the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable is conditional upon the value that the exogenous variables are held fixed at. This conditionality is noted in \cite{hEvY05}. I name this structural characteristic the conditional average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable and index it by the conditioning value.\footnote{\cite{hEvY05} defines a parameter $ATE(x)$ that is equivalent to the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable. \cite{kHt10} and \cite{13.misc.abrevaya} instead refer to this parameter as the conditional average treatment effect and abbreviate this as $CATE(x)$.} Instrumental variables do not enter the structural equation for the outcome variable and so only enrich individual selection.  

Incorporating information is generally sensible for a number of reasons. Firstly, understanding the effect of an intervention in various sub-populations can be interesting. This is particularly true if the intervention can be targeted, or if the intervention is to be applied elsewhere in a population that differs according to its observable characteristics. Conditional average causal effects develop a more detailed picture of the distribution of the effect of an intervention. Secondly, incorporating information is known to be efficient; variation that is attributable to an observable variable is instead attributed to unobservable heterogeneity when that variable is omitted. Thirdly, the effect of incorporating information for partially identifying models is not well-documented; one hypothesis is that incorporating information leads to narrower bounds on admissible sets. Such an effect is not documented in identifying models precisely because such models deliver a point estimate (a set of length zero), but point estimates may shift as information is incorporated. A contribution that I make is in showing that \color{red} incorporating information leads to narrower bounds on the admissible sets \color{black} that are delivered by the aforementioned model. 

The non-parametric binary choice model that I assume is the same as that in \cite{cr13} except that I enrich individual behaviour. The distinction is that \cite{cr13} allow only the endogenous variable to determine the threshold 




%A complication of working with partially identifying models is in determining the admissible set of values for a structural characteristic of interest. Fortunately, application of random set theory to economics  

%Determining the admissible set of values for the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable and establishing that the bounds on this set are sharp has been made easier by the application of random set theory to economics. 
%

%
%This paper is an extension of \cite{cr13}. Like \cite{cr13}, I specify a non-parametric model that embeds a threshold crossing restriction and study the admissible set of values for the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable that is delivered by this model. \cite{cr13} estimates the admissible set of values for the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable and compares this to estimates of the local average treatment effect.\footnote{It should be noted that these are not only distinct parameters but that each is identified (or partially identified) under a non-nested set of restrictions.} In contrast, my interest is only in the average causal effect of the endogenous variable on the outcome variable. As in \cite{cr13}, estimates are for data on female labour force participation in the \US , but I also derive general conditions on the probability distribution of observable variables that are necessary for each model to deliver different bounds. 


%==================================================%
\section*{Notation}
There is a probability space $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mathbb{P})$ on which are defined random variables $(Y,D,X,Z,U)$. Here, $(Y,D,X,Z)$ are observable with supports $(\mathcal{R}_Y,\mathcal{R}_D,\mathcal{R}_X,\mathcal{R}_Z)$, and $U$ is unobservable with as yet unspecified support. I allow $(X,Z,U)$ to be vectors, in which case the support is given by the Cartesian product of the supports of each element in the vector. I refer to $Y$ as the outcome variable, to $D$ as the endogenous variable, to $X$ as the exogenous variable, to $Z$ as the instrumental variable, and to $U$ as unobservable heterogeneity. The logic of this naming convention will be made clear by the restrictions that are imposed upon these random variables in the main text. Lower case letters are used to represent specific values of these random variables.

I denote by $Y(d)$ the counterfactual value of $Y$ when $D$ is externally fixed, and by $D(z)$ the counterfactual value of $D$ when $Z$ is externally fixed. I denote by $\mathbb{E}$ the expectation operator, and  by $\mathbbm{1}$ the indicator function. Related to these concepts are the average causal effects $ACE(D\rightarrow Y)$ and $ACE(Z\rightarrow D)$ that are defined as $\mathbb{E}[Y(d_1)-Y(d_0)]$ and $\mathbb{E}[D(z_1)-D(z_0)]$ that are well-defined when $D$ and $Z$ are binary, respectively. To distinguish between population and sample quantities, I subscript sample quantities by $n$. 

Further terminology and notation is introduced in Figure~\ref{fig:models} through Figure~\ref{fig:partials}. This specifically relates to models and structures, and is consistent with the approach that is formally laid out in \cite{h50} and in \cite{krE50}. Following \cite{h50} I also adopt the notation $S\generates P$ that signifies that a structure $S$ generates a probability distribution (of observable variables) $P$, and $P\generated G$ that signifies that $P$ is generated by $S$.

The class of all probability distributions (of observable variables) is partitioned into the blue partition $\color{red}\mathcal{P}$ and into the red partition $\color{blue}\mathcal{P}$. Probability distributions in $\color{red}\mathcal{P}$ are generated by (potentially many) structures in $\color{red}\mathcal{M}$, and probability distributions in $\color{blue}\mathcal{P}$ are generated by (potentially many) structures in $\color{blue}\mathcal{M}$. It is important that the number of partitions in $\mathcal{M}$ and in $\mathcal{P}$ are equal, although that number can be countably infinite. In the context of Figure~\ref{fig:uniform} $\mathcal{M}$ uniformly identifies $\chi$ since observationally equivalent structures that $\mathcal{M}$ admits are in the same colour of $\mathcal{M}$. More conveniently, whether $\mathcal{M}$ uniformly identifies $\chi$ can be determined by the existence of an identifying correspondence $G$, a functional. $\color{red}P$ is a probability distribution in $\color{red}\mathcal{P}$, and $\color{blue}P$ is a probability distribution in $\color{blue}\mathcal{P}$. Then $\mathcal{M}$ uniformly identifies $\chi$ if the value of $G(\color{red}P\color{black})$ is $a$ and if the value of $G(\color{blue}P\color{black})$ is $b$, holding for any such $\color{red}P$ and $\color{blue}P$.

So $\mathcal{M}$ does not uniformly identify $\chi$. Consideration of the identifying correspondence $G$ determines that this corresponds to there being structures in $\mathcal{M}$ for which $G$ does not deliver the value of $\chi$ when applied to the probability distributions that these structures generate. Nonetheless, if $\mathcal{M}$ restricts the set of values of $\chi$ for any probability distribution in $\mathcal{P}$ then $\mathcal{M}$ does have some non-trivial identifying power for $\chi$. Then $\mathcal{M}$ is said to uniformly partially identify $\chi$ if $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{P}$ can each be partitioned into countably many disjoint subsets and that a probability distribution in a partition of $\mathcal{P}$ is not generated by a structure in at least one partition of $\mathcal{M}$, holding for any such partition of $\mathcal{P}$. In the context of Figure~\ref{fig:partials} $\color{red}\mathcal{M}$ identifies $\chi$ up to $\lbrace a,c\rbrace$, $\color{blue}\mathcal{M}$ identifies $\chi$ uniquely to $b$, and $\color{yellow}\mathcal{M}$ identifies $\chi$ up to $\lbrace a,c\rbrace$. Each partition of $\mathcal{P}$ includes probability distributions that are generated by structures in at least one partition of $\mathcal{M}$. Equivalently, if $G$ is permitted to be a multivalued functional (or one-to-many) then $\mathcal{M}$ uniformly partially identifies $\chi$ if $G$ exists and if $G(P)$ contains the set of values of $\chi$ that are delivered by structures that generate $P$, holding for all such $P$. A caveat must be applied here; $G$ cannot be trivial in the sense that it is constant across all such $P$. Clearly this definition of $G$ does not exclude the possibility that there is multiplicity of identifying correspondences that satisfy this property. Sharpness is a desirable property in such circumstances; a functional $G$ that can be shown to deliver smaller sets according to some well-defined distance measure across all possible $P$ (and that satisfies the properties above) should be preferred to any alternative identifying correspondence.}

%I explore the effect of incorporating information on the identified set of values for the average causal effect of an endogenous variable on an outcome variable (the parameter of interest) that is delivered by a non-parametric model that embeds an exclusion restriction and an independence restriction that together characterise an instrumental variable. Endogenous variation enters the model since agents are permitted to non-randomly select a scalar observable characteristic. I consider the effect of combining many instrumental variables into a composite instrumental variable with many points of support on the identified set of values for counterfactual outcome distributions. Further, I consider the effect of enriching individual behaviour by allowing relevant exogenous variables to affect individual choice; specifically, I allow these variables to enter the structural equations that determine the endogenous variable and that determine the outcome variable. I establish the conditions under which the parameter of interest in the enriched model is equivalent to the parameter of interest in a model that does not explicitly account for the contribution of additional relevant exogenous variables. 
%
%The model that I consider partially identifies the parameter of interest. That is, the restrictions on the set of admissible structures (or data generating processes) that are implied by the model are insufficient to exclude observationally equivalent structures that deliver different values of the parameter of interest. The restrictions that are implied are nonetheless sufficient to restrict the set of values of the parameter of interest up to a non-trivial set. This concept is described graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:partials}.

%Points to make:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Non-parametric IV model with endogenous variable
%\item Non-random selection
%\item Average causal effect of endogenous variable on outcome variable is parameter of interest
%\item Model partially identifies the parameter of interest
%\item Model is weakly restrictive in that it does not specify a distribution for unobserved heterogeneity (imposes a normalisation and allows all distributional assumption to enter the non-parametric threshold function) and does not specify a selection equation
